### (To view the output, please refer the project report which is attached)

## About: 
 1) The player is shown a bold text in a screen which lasts for 3 seconds. Then the text screen vanishes and the player prompted to enter the text which he/she saw in   the screen.
 2) If the user correctly enters the text, the score is increased and user is shown the next text.
 3) If wrongly answered, the game is finished leading to score board where the player's name is asked and then, other players score are rendered in sorted manner.
 4) As the level increases, the complexity of the text to remember is increased and the screen time of bold text is decreased.
